# KGP-Plugin-Series
An open source set of audio plugins written in C++ that perform basic audio mixing procedures like Equalizing and Compressing audio signals

Currently finished : KGP Equalizer

Planning on developing : KGP Compressor, KGP Reverb, KGP Delay

# Installation
The plugin was developed using projucer and hence would require the same to build the dll files which would be used by the Digital Audio Workstations to run the plugin.
Tested the equalizer on FL Studio 20.
